# üì¶ Changelog

## [1.1.4] - 2025-07-29

### Fixed
- **LinkSORegistry**
  - `FindLinksFrom<TLeft, TRight>()` and `FindLinksTo<TLeft, TRight>()` returned empty results when using subclasses like `ObjectVisibilityLinkData`
  - Registry now correctly registers links using the **generic base type** (`LinkSO<TLeft, TRight>`) instead of the concrete subclass
  - Added logging for registration and queries to diagnose type mismatches and missing link data

### Changed
- `Register(ScriptableObject)` now resolves the generic base type using `.GetType().BaseType` and validates it is a `LinkSO<,>` before storing
- `FindLinksFrom` and `FindLinksTo` now reliably return matches for subclassed `LinkSO` types by keying lookups on the generic base
- Debug logging added to:
  - `Register(...)`: logs the link name and base type
  - `FindLinksFrom(...)`: logs query type and number of links found

### Added
- Manual registration support for dynamically created links using:
  ```csharp
  var link = ScriptableObject.CreateInstance<TLink>();
  link.LeftSO.Value = sourceSO;
  link.RightSO.Value = targetSO;
  Access.Query<LinkSORegistry>().Register(link);


## [1.1.3] - 2025-05-28

### Fixed
- **StaticDependencyGraphView**
  - Incorrect spacing after grouped SOs caused overlapping ungrouped nodes
  - Now tracks the last Y position of the final node in a group (`lastNodeYInGroup`)
  - Ensures consistent spacing between groups and ungrouped SOs using `yCursor = Mathf.Max(yCursor, lastUsedY + 80f)`

### Changed
- Group and ungrouped layout spacing logic unified for predictable stacking
- Group rendering still includes correct proxy connection and centered layout
- `LinkTreeGraphView` auto-open behavior updated:
  - If the window is **not visible**, it does nothing
  - If the window **is already open**, it will dynamically refresh without reopening or stealing focus
- Renamed:
  - `ReaCSIndexRegistry` ‚ûù `IndexRegistry`
  - `Use<T>` and `Query<T>` moved to the `ReaCS.Runtime.Access` namespace


## [1.1.2] - 2025-05-28

### Added
- **Execution Trace Graph** window:
  - Visualizes runtime propagation chains: System ‚ûù Field ‚ûù System ‚ûù ...
  - Each node shows SO name, field name, and old ‚ûù new value
  - Strict left-to-right layout with vertical fan-out for fields
  - Causal flow tracking from runtime history system
  - Custom edge and node styling, including source indicators (e.g. üß© for external triggers)
  - Hover previews for system code
- **Syntax highlighting** for system previews:
  - Visual Studio-like color palette
  - Supports keywords, types, methods, numbers, properties, symbols
  - Preserves spacing and formatting exactly using `WhiteSpace.Pre`
  - Detects `nameof(...)` patterns and colors inner content
  - Tracks and highlights inside `${}` interpolated expressions recursively

### Fixed
- `Label` rendering collapsed multiple spaces; fixed using `whiteSpace = WhiteSpace.Pre`
- Misclassification of capitalized properties like `Value` as types
- Strings with `${}` were previously unstyled; now parsed and highlighted correctly

### Changed
- Visual system nodes now include hoverable code previews with syntax color
- `CreateTokenLabel()` uses strict layout styling to match source format



## [1.1.1] ‚Äì 2025-05-26 ‚Äî Link Tree Graph & LinkSO/ObservableScriptableObject Visualization

### ‚ú® Added

* **`LinkTreeGraphView`**:
  A fully recursive visual explorer for `LinkSO<TLeft, TRight>` relationships.

  * Starting from any `ObservableScriptableObject`, it renders a directional graph showing how objects are linked.
  * Highlights the root node.
  * Pressing `P` on a node pings the asset in the Project window.
  * Built-in **MiniMap**, zoom, and pan support.
  * Automatically centers view after generating the graph.

* **Auto-open Link Graph**:
  Selecting an `ObservableScriptableObject` in the **Project window** automatically opens the Link Tree Graph.

* **Traversal Enhancements**:

  * Prevents infinite cycles and redundant links.
  * Follows `TLeft ‚ûî TRight` directionality for visual clarity.
  * Skips links already visually expressed in the graph.
  * When a node is expanded, it spawns a new tree section rather than reusing global shared nodes.

### üõ† Changed

* **SO Inspector UI**:

  * Removed the "Open Link Tree Graph" button.
  * Replaced with static display showing how many links are present for the current `ObservableScriptableObject`.

* **Graph Layout Improvements**:

  * Added `FrameGraphToCenter()` after layout generation to ensure nodes are centered and spaced correctly.
  * Fixed cases where nodes would render off-screen or to the top-left due to early layout timing.

### üêõ Fixed

* üß† Nodes are no longer duplicated when expanding new links (unless explicitly allowed for visual clarity).
* ‚ôª The root node is no longer overridden or skipped during recursive expansion.
* üéØ `PingObject` now works correctly for all node types and expansion states.
* üé® Nodes are placed consistently and logically with vertical spacing depending on number of links.



##  [1.1.0] 26/05/2025 ‚Äî Entity-Based Binding Overhaul

### ‚ú® Added
- **`ComponentDataBinding<TSO, TUC>`**
  - Binds an `ObservableScriptableObject` (TSO) to a Unity Component (TUC).
  - Auto-resolves the Unity `component` via (TUC) generic and recommended `[RequireComponent]`.
  - Supports a single `dataSource` field with a `useAsTemplate` toggle.
    - If `dataSource` is not filled, instantiate (TSO) with no data and pool it.
    - If filled and `useAsTemplate` = true, instantiate (TSO) and copy data from `dataSource` to `data`, then pool
    - If filled and `useAsTemplate` = false, instantiate (TSO) and `data` = `dataSource` to use project-bound SO and 
      fields auto-save features so data is saved across playthroughs
  - Automatically registers to:
    - `SharedEntityIdService` (for shared `EntityId`)
    - `ComponentDataBindingService<TSO>`
    - `ReaCSIndexRegistry`

- **`SharedEntityIdService`**
  - Auto-assigns a stable `EntityId` to each GameObject hierarchy.
  - Used to group all components in a hierarchy into a logical entity.

- **`EntityId` struct**
  - Replaces `EntitySO` entirely.
  - Compact, Burst-safe, integer-based entity reference.

- **`ComponentDataBindingService<TSO>`**
  - Fast SO ‚ûù MonoBehaviour lookup at runtime.
  - Enables system-to-UnityComponent access via entity or SO.

- **`UnifiedObservableRegistry`**
  - Combines `ObservableRegistry` (editor) and `ReaCSIndexRegistry` (runtime).
  - Key methods:
    - `GetAll<T>()` auto-resolves editor/runtime mode.
    - `GetByEntity<T>(EntityId)`
    - `GetBindingsForEntity<T, TBinding>()`
    - `BuildNativeLookup<T, TField>()` ‚Äî Burst-compatible NativeArray export.

- **`PoolService<T>`**
  - Replacement for `ReaCSPool<T>`.
  - Accessed via `Use<PoolService<T>>()` for clean pooling.

- **LinkSO cleanup logic** in `ReaCSIndexRegistry` and editor tool:
  - Removes broken links referencing null SOs.
  - Editor utility auto-cleans invalid LinkSO assets using `LinkedSOLookup`.

- **EntityId-to-ComponentDataBinding query path**
  - Systems can now go from `EntityId` ‚ûù `SO` ‚ûù `MonoBehaviour` ‚ûù UnityComponent in 1 step.

### üõ† Changed
- `ComponentDataBinding<TSO>`:
  - Now supports optional `dataSource` with `useAsTemplate` toggle instead of separate static/template fields.
  - Only one SO field required.
- SOs that implement `IHasEntityId` now receive their `EntityId` automatically.
- Systems no longer require manual links or `EntitySO`-based ownership modeling.
- Renamed `ComponentDataBindingLookup<T>` to `ComponentDataBindingService<T>` for clarity and consistency with other `Use<T>()`-based services.

### üßπ Removed / Deprecated
- ‚ùå `EntitySO` ‚Äî replaced by `ReaCSEntityId`
- ‚ùå `IHasData`, `IHasStaticData` ‚Äî replaced by `IHasDataSource<T>`
- ‚ùå `ReaCSPool<T>` ‚Äî replaced by `PoolService<T>`
- Deprecated usage of `ObservableRegistry` directly in favor of `UnifiedObservableRegistry` for runtime queries.

### üêõ Fixed
- üß† Runtime systems now persist across domain reloads in play mode.
- ‚úÖ All systems and bindings auto-reconnect to SOs using new `SharedEntityIdService`.
- ‚úÖ `OnChanged` / `MarkDirty` / visual graph pulses work after reloads.
- üîÅ Pooled SOs correctly re-acquire entity link and name after recycling.
