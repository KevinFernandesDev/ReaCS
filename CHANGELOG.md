# üì¶ Changelog

# [1.2.1] - 2025-08-04

### Added
- **Full Editor support for complex `Observable<T>` field types**  
  - Added robust drawer support for Unity UIElements style structs such as `StyleInt`, `StyleFloat`, `StyleColor`, and notably `StyleEnum<T>`.  
  - Supported Unity‚Äôs `StyleLengthBoxed` type with correct field editing for `Length`, `LengthUnit`, and `StyleKeyword`.  
  - Enhanced handling for Unity Localization‚Äôs `LocaleString` with dropdowns for table and entry selection in the inspector.  
  - Editor drawer now gracefully handles standard Unity types (`Vector2`, `Vector3`, `Quaternion`, `Color`, enums, primitives) and shows a clear label for unsupported types.  

- **Addressables support**  
  - Integrated support for `AssetReference` and generic `AssetReferenceT<T>` types in editor. 

### Fixed
- **UIToolkit data binding and serialization**  
  - Prevented UIToolkit from exposing internal `_value` backing fields of `Observable<T>`.
  - Retained serialization of `_value` while exposing only the `[CreateProperty]` decorated `Value` property to UI Toolkit.  

- **Localization error handling**  
  - Avoided errors from empty or invalid localization table references by adding validation and fallbacks in the drawer UI.

- **Editor UI fixes**   
  - Fixed problems with asset selection persisting properly across multi-object editing sessions.

### Changed
- Switched from complex dropdown UI for addressables to Unity‚Äôs standard `ObjectField` to improve UX and reliability.

### Removed
- Removed experimental `ObservableBoxed<T>` backing field approach in favor of `_value` hiding.


# [1.2.0] - 2025-08-01

### Added
- **EntityService and EntityRegistry**:
  - Added `EntityService` for creating entities, registering/unregistering ObservableObjects, and releasing all SOs for an entity on destroy.
  - `EntityRegistry` now tracks all EntityId relationships, their registered ScriptableObjects, and provides lookup for SOs by EntityId.
  - Entities can be registered via `EntityService.CreateEntityFor(Transform)`, which automatically adds an `Entity` MonoBehaviour and assigns a unique `EntityId`.

- **Entity-aware pooling for Data, Tag, and Link**:
  - All pools (`DataPool<T>`, `TagPool<T>`, `LinkPool<T>`) now support an optional `EntityId` parameter on `Get()`, associating pooled objects with an entity in the registry for robust cleanup.
  - Pools use `IPoolable` and a unified `SetPool(this)` pattern, so SOs self-release to the correct pool without type checks or manual management.

- **DataAdapter and DataAdapterRegistry overhaul**:
  - Added a generic `DataAdapter<TData, TUC>` for binding any Data SO to a Unity Component, with runtime and design-time wiring.
  - Introduced runtime service-based DataAdapter creation (`DataAdapterService`), supporting both hierarchy-based and direct EntityId assignment, with warning and fallback for missing entities.
  - `DataAdapterRegistry<TData>` supports lookup by SO, by EntityId (now using `EntityId` struct), and by Unity component type.

### Changed
- **All EntityId relationship logic**:
  - `EntityId` is now a struct (no more int or interface-based tracking). No need to add EntityId to ObservableObject; all relationships are tracked via `EntityRegistry`.
  - Pools and services express all entity‚ÄìSO relationships via the registry, not via fields on SOs.
  - Entity creation logic is unified: design-time and runtime registration both handled consistently.

- **ObservableObject, Data, Tag, Link renaming and rearchitecturing**:
  - All `Release` logic for SOs is routed through their pool via the `IPoolable` interface.
  - Removed manual SO tracking from pools; now handled by `EntityRegistry` and `EntityService`.

- **DataAdapter lifecycle**:
  - `DataAdapter<TData, TUC>` can be created with or without an EntityId, supporting both GLTF flat instantiation and prefab hierarchies.
  - `OnEnable`/`Awake` deferred init pattern allows DataAdapterService to inject setup before first frame.
  - DataAdapter will auto-add an `Entity` to the root if none is found in the hierarchy, with a clear developer warning.
  

### Fixed
- **Release and cleanup**:
  - Ensured all SOs (Data, Tag, Link) associated with a given entity are released when that entity is destroyed, preventing leaks and double-registration.
  - Fixed cases where DataAdapter created at runtime without an entity would fail; now robust fallback to root Entity.

### Internal
- Updated comments and docs to reflect all new service, registry, and pooling patterns.
- Unified naming conventions: TSO ‚Üí TData (where appropriate), no more IHasEntityId.



## [1.1.6] - 2025-07-29

### Changed
- **SystemBase renamed to Reactor**
  - All `SystemBase` types and usages have been renamed to `Reactor` for clarity and consistency across codebase and docs.

### Fixed
- **Execution Trace Graph layout and robustness**
  - System nodes now always start at the leftmost column, with corresponding field nodes appearing directly to their right.
  - Fixed node placement and stacking issues after timeline discontinuities (frame gaps).
  - Fixed a bug where field nodes could appear misaligned after consecutive graph rebuilds.
  - Ensured the graph clears and resets properly on runtime gaps for reliable visual tracing.

### Internal
- Updated all docs, comments, and internal registration to match new `Reactor` naming.



## [1.1.5] - 2025-07-29

### Added
- **Link pooling support** via `PoolService<T>`:
  - `GetLink<TLink, TLeft, TRight>(left, right)` creates or reuses a pooled `LinkSO`
  - Calls `SetLinks()` internally to assign `LeftSO` and `RightSO`
  - Automatically registers the link in `LinkSORegistry`
- `LinkSO<TLeft, TRight>.SetLinks(left, right)`:
  - Assigns link endpoints
  - Registers link if not already registered
  - Supports chaining and pooling
- `_isRegistered` instance flag in `LinkSO`:
  - Prevents double-registration
  - Reset in `ClearLink()` for safe reuse from pool

### Changed
- `BindAll<TSOParent, TSOChild, TUC, TBinding, TLink>()` now uses `PoolService<LinkSO<...>>` to create links via `GetLink(...)`

### Notes
- Use `PoolService` for performance-critical or large-scale link creation

## [1.1.4] - 2025-07-29

### Fixed
- **LinkSORegistry**
  - `FindLinksFrom<TLeft, TRight>()` and `FindLinksTo<TLeft, TRight>()` returned empty results when using subclasses like `ObjectVisibilityLinkData`
  - Registry now correctly registers links using the **generic base type** (`LinkSO<TLeft, TRight>`) instead of the concrete subclass
  - Added logging for registration and queries to diagnose type mismatches and missing link data

### Changed
- `Register(ScriptableObject)` now resolves the generic base type using `.GetType().BaseType` and validates it is a `LinkSO<,>` before storing
- `FindLinksFrom` and `FindLinksTo` now reliably return matches for subclassed `LinkSO` types by keying lookups on the generic base
- Debug logging added to:
  - `Register(...)`: logs the link name and base type
  - `FindLinksFrom(...)`: logs query type and number of links found

### Added
- Manual registration support for dynamically created links using:
  ```csharp
  var link = ScriptableObject.CreateInstance<TLink>();
  link.LeftSO.Value = sourceSO;
  link.RightSO.Value = targetSO;
  Access.Query<LinkSORegistry>().Register(link);


## [1.1.3] - 2025-05-28

### Fixed
- **StaticDependencyGraphView**
  - Incorrect spacing after grouped SOs caused overlapping ungrouped nodes
  - Now tracks the last Y position of the final node in a group (`lastNodeYInGroup`)
  - Ensures consistent spacing between groups and ungrouped SOs using `yCursor = Mathf.Max(yCursor, lastUsedY + 80f)`

### Changed
- Group and ungrouped layout spacing logic unified for predictable stacking
- Group rendering still includes correct proxy connection and centered layout
- `LinkTreeGraphView` auto-open behavior updated:
  - If the window is **not visible**, it does nothing
  - If the window **is already open**, it will dynamically refresh without reopening or stealing focus
- Renamed:
  - `ReaCSIndexRegistry` ‚ûù `IndexRegistry`
  - `Use<T>` and `Query<T>` moved to the `ReaCS.Runtime.Access` namespace


## [1.1.2] - 2025-05-28

### Added
- **Execution Trace Graph** window:
  - Visualizes runtime propagation chains: System ‚ûù Field ‚ûù System ‚ûù ...
  - Each node shows SO name, field name, and old ‚ûù new value
  - Strict left-to-right layout with vertical fan-out for fields
  - Causal flow tracking from runtime history system
  - Custom edge and node styling, including source indicators (e.g. üß© for external triggers)
  - Hover previews for system code
- **Syntax highlighting** for system previews:
  - Visual Studio-like color palette
  - Supports keywords, types, methods, numbers, properties, symbols
  - Preserves spacing and formatting exactly using `WhiteSpace.Pre`
  - Detects `nameof(...)` patterns and colors inner content
  - Tracks and highlights inside `${}` interpolated expressions recursively

### Fixed
- `Label` rendering collapsed multiple spaces; fixed using `whiteSpace = WhiteSpace.Pre`
- Misclassification of capitalized properties like `Value` as types
- Strings with `${}` were previously unstyled; now parsed and highlighted correctly

### Changed
- Visual system nodes now include hoverable code previews with syntax color
- `CreateTokenLabel()` uses strict layout styling to match source format



## [1.1.1] ‚Äì 2025-05-26 ‚Äî Link Tree Graph & LinkSO/ObservableScriptableObject Visualization

### ‚ú® Added

* **`LinkTreeGraphView`**:
  A fully recursive visual explorer for `LinkSO<TLeft, TRight>` relationships.

  * Starting from any `ObservableScriptableObject`, it renders a directional graph showing how objects are linked.
  * Highlights the root node.
  * Pressing `P` on a node pings the asset in the Project window.
  * Built-in **MiniMap**, zoom, and pan support.
  * Automatically centers view after generating the graph.

* **Auto-open Link Graph**:
  Selecting an `ObservableScriptableObject` in the **Project window** automatically opens the Link Tree Graph.

* **Traversal Enhancements**:

  * Prevents infinite cycles and redundant links.
  * Follows `TLeft ‚ûî TRight` directionality for visual clarity.
  * Skips links already visually expressed in the graph.
  * When a node is expanded, it spawns a new tree section rather than reusing global shared nodes.

### üõ† Changed

* **SO Inspector UI**:

  * Removed the "Open Link Tree Graph" button.
  * Replaced with static display showing how many links are present for the current `ObservableScriptableObject`.

* **Graph Layout Improvements**:

  * Added `FrameGraphToCenter()` after layout generation to ensure nodes are centered and spaced correctly.
  * Fixed cases where nodes would render off-screen or to the top-left due to early layout timing.

### üêõ Fixed

* üß† Nodes are no longer duplicated when expanding new links (unless explicitly allowed for visual clarity).
* ‚ôª The root node is no longer overridden or skipped during recursive expansion.
* üéØ `PingObject` now works correctly for all node types and expansion states.
* üé® Nodes are placed consistently and logically with vertical spacing depending on number of links.



##  [1.1.0] 26/05/2025 ‚Äî Entity-Based Binding Overhaul

### ‚ú® Added
- **`ComponentDataBinding<TSO, TUC>`**
  - Binds an `ObservableScriptableObject` (TSO) to a Unity Component (TUC).
  - Auto-resolves the Unity `component` via (TUC) generic and recommended `[RequireComponent]`.
  - Supports a single `dataSource` field with a `useAsTemplate` toggle.
    - If `dataSource` is not filled, instantiate (TSO) with no data and pool it.
    - If filled and `useAsTemplate` = true, instantiate (TSO) and copy data from `dataSource` to `data`, then pool
    - If filled and `useAsTemplate` = false, instantiate (TSO) and `data` = `dataSource` to use project-bound SO and 
      fields auto-save features so data is saved across playthroughs
  - Automatically registers to:
    - `SharedEntityIdService` (for shared `EntityId`)
    - `ComponentDataBindingService<TSO>`
    - `ReaCSIndexRegistry`

- **`SharedEntityIdService`**
  - Auto-assigns a stable `EntityId` to each GameObject hierarchy.
  - Used to group all components in a hierarchy into a logical entity.

- **`EntityId` struct**
  - Replaces `EntitySO` entirely.
  - Compact, Burst-safe, integer-based entity reference.

- **`ComponentDataBindingService<TSO>`**
  - Fast SO ‚ûù MonoBehaviour lookup at runtime.
  - Enables system-to-UnityComponent access via entity or SO.

- **`UnifiedObservableRegistry`**
  - Combines `ObservableRegistry` (editor) and `ReaCSIndexRegistry` (runtime).
  - Key methods:
    - `GetAll<T>()` auto-resolves editor/runtime mode.
    - `GetByEntity<T>(EntityId)`
    - `GetBindingsForEntity<T, TBinding>()`
    - `BuildNativeLookup<T, TField>()` ‚Äî Burst-compatible NativeArray export.

- **`PoolService<T>`**
  - Replacement for `ReaCSPool<T>`.
  - Accessed via `Use<PoolService<T>>()` for clean pooling.

- **LinkSO cleanup logic** in `ReaCSIndexRegistry` and editor tool:
  - Removes broken links referencing null SOs.
  - Editor utility auto-cleans invalid LinkSO assets using `LinkedSOLookup`.

- **EntityId-to-ComponentDataBinding query path**
  - Systems can now go from `EntityId` ‚ûù `SO` ‚ûù `MonoBehaviour` ‚ûù UnityComponent in 1 step.

### üõ† Changed
- `ComponentDataBinding<TSO>`:
  - Now supports optional `dataSource` with `useAsTemplate` toggle instead of separate static/template fields.
  - Only one SO field required.
- SOs that implement `IHasEntityId` now receive their `EntityId` automatically.
- Systems no longer require manual links or `EntitySO`-based ownership modeling.
- Renamed `ComponentDataBindingLookup<T>` to `ComponentDataBindingService<T>` for clarity and consistency with other `Use<T>()`-based services.

### üßπ Removed / Deprecated
- ‚ùå `EntitySO` ‚Äî replaced by `ReaCSEntityId`
- ‚ùå `IHasData`, `IHasStaticData` ‚Äî replaced by `IHasDataSource<T>`
- ‚ùå `ReaCSPool<T>` ‚Äî replaced by `PoolService<T>`
- Deprecated usage of `ObservableRegistry` directly in favor of `UnifiedObservableRegistry` for runtime queries.

### üêõ Fixed
- üß† Runtime systems now persist across domain reloads in play mode.
- ‚úÖ All systems and bindings auto-reconnect to SOs using new `SharedEntityIdService`.
- ‚úÖ `OnChanged` / `MarkDirty` / visual graph pulses work after reloads.
- üîÅ Pooled SOs correctly re-acquire entity link and name after recycling.
