# ReaCS Documentation

Welcome to the **ReaCS** (Reactive Component System) documentation.

ReaCS is a lightweight reactive architecture for Unity using `Observable<T>` and `ScriptableObject`-based data flow.  
This package is designed to simplify data-driven development and clean separation of logic, UI, and state.
