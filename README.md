# ReaCS - Reactive Component System for Unity

ReaCS is an opinionated lightweight Reactive Data-Driven Architecture that uses Observable data with ScriptableObjects to enable automatic UI binding, reactivity, and clean separation of data and logic with a state-as-truth behavior in Unity's game engine.

## Features
âœ… State-as-truth

âœ… Guardrails by design

âœ… Close to zero boilerplate

âœ… Transparent zero setup

âœ… No inheritance promoted (Reactive SO data-driven architecture) compatible with interfaces when needed

âœ… Promotes Interfaces for observable ScriptableObjects when needed

âœ… Observables in ScriptableObjects baked in transparently behind the scenes

âœ… Enforced SRP (Single-Responsability Principal) with "Systems" 

âœ… Enforces *only one SO* to react to

âœ… Enforces *only one field* to track

âœ… Centralized runtime watcher with debounce for performance

âœ… Clean API for devs: no subscriptions, no events, cross-monobehavior referencing or data/method accesses, and no string mistakes

âœ… Works for designers using Unity regular workflow for data editing and addition of new data

âœ… Easy to scale

âœ… Easy to test

âœ… Easy to debug (one system = one job)

âœ… Easy to analyze, visualize, or extend later

âœ… Easy to maintain

âœ… Consistent architecture

âœ… Covered by Unity Tests & Coverage tool (dependencies)

âœ… Custom drawer for SO fields Inspector usability

âœ… Custom graph-based debugging tool to inspect Systems, with

## Usage
1. Add the package via Git in your Unity project:
```json
"com.kevinfernandes.reacs": "https://github.com/KevinFernandesDev/ReaCS.git"
```

2. Create a ScriptableObject that extends `ObservableScriptableObject` and add Attribute `[Observable]` and `Observable<T>` to a field:
```csharp
public class ExperienceSO : ObservableScriptableObject {
    [Observable] public Observable<string> name;
    [Observable] public Observable<Sprite> icon;
}
```

3. In a Monobehavior inheriting from SystemBase, observe changes like this:
```csharp
[ReactTo(nameof(ExperienceSO.isSelected))]
public class ExperienceSelectSystem : SystemBase<ExperienceSO>
{
    protected override void OnFieldChanged(ExperienceSO changedSO)
    {
            // Reacts only when any ExperienceSO's `isSelected` changes
            experience.name.OnChanged += newName => Debug.Log("New name: " + newName);
    }
}
```
